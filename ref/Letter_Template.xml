			Dear <prefix1>Mr.</prefix1> & <prefix2>Mrs.</prefix2> <fname1>Edwin</fname2> & <fname2>Leilani</fname2> <lname>Price Jr.</lname>,
		</salutation>

		I'm interested in purchasing your apartments. Are you interested in selling?

		As a property owner, I realize that there are a number of reasons why someone may be interested in selling: Bad Management, Hassles of being a Landlord, Divorce, a Death or Retirement! Everyone has their own reason and my question to you is; are you now ready to sell? If, so I am ready to buy!

		Give me a call and we can discuss the possibility of me buying your property.

		Please contact me at your earliest convenience so that we can discuss the sale of your property. At least you will know how much you can get for it so that you can make an educated decision as to sell or keep your property. 

		Call me now at 410-725-8737. I look forward to hearing from you.


		Sincerely,
		Trevor Finn		
		
		P.S. Now may be the right time and opportunity to make a change in your multifamily holdings. Call me now at 410-725-8737.
